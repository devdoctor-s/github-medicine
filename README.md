As a developer, here are 10 common missing knowledge about Github:

1.  Understanding the difference between Git and Github: Git is a version control system, while Github is a hosting platform for Git repositories.
    
2.  Knowing how to create and manage branches: Branches allow developers to work on different features or versions of a project simultaneously, and merge changes back into the main codebase.
    
3.  Familiarity with pull requests: Pull requests are a way to propose changes to a codebase and to review and discuss those changes with other contributors.
    
4.  Understanding how to resolve merge conflicts: Merge conflicts occur when two or more people make changes to the same file, and Github needs help deciding which changes to keep.
    
5.  Knowing how to use issues and labels: Issues and labels help manage and organize work on a project by tracking bugs, feature requests, and other tasks.
    
6.  Knowing how to use Github Actions: Github Actions allow developers to automate tasks, such as testing and deploying code, using workflows.
    
7.  Understanding how to collaborate with others on Github: Collaborating on Github involves understanding how to fork a repository, make changes, and create pull requests.
    
8.  Knowing how to use Github Pages: Github Pages allows developers to host static websites and showcase their work.
    
9.  Understanding how to use Github's search feature: Github's search feature allows developers to find code, issues, and other content on the platform.
    
10.  Knowing how to use Github's API: Github's API allows developers to programmatically access and interact with Github data, such as repositories, issues, and pull requests.

Difference between Git and Github
---------------------------------

Git and Github are often confused as being the same thing, but they are actually two different things. Here are the differences:

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is open-source software. Git allows developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, collaborate on changes, and keep a history of all changes made to the codebase. It can be used offline and is available on all major operating systems.

### Github

Github is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It was created in 2008 and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. Github offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for working with Git repositories, as well as additional features such as pull requests, issues, and wikis. Github also offers social coding features, such as the ability to follow other developers and projects, contribute to open-source projects, and discover new projects.

In summary, Git is a version control system, while Github is a hosting platform for Git repositories. While Git can be used offline, Github requires an internet connection to access its features. Understanding the difference between Git and Github is essential for any developer who wants to work with code repositories and collaborate with others on code projects.
